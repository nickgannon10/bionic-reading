input_string = """Once upon a time, in a small town tucked between the gentle hills, lived a young boy named Liam. He was known for his curiosity and his penchant for exploration, often found with a dirty pair of jeans and a spirit humming with adventure.

One spring afternoon, as the sun painted a golden hue across the town, Liam set out for his daily expedition. Today's destination was the old meadow, a vast expanse of green that was a stone's throw away from his house, yet an area he'd never fully explored.

The meadow was brimming with life, a harmony of dancing butterflies, buzzing bees, and chirping birds. However, what caught Liam's eye was not the typical allure of the meadow but a field of seemingly endless yellow blooms. They looked like a thousand tiny suns, a sea of gold amidst the green."""
